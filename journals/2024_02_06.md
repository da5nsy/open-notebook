- ✨Hello world! ✨
- Today is an exciting day, because today is the day that I start my little experiment in [[open-notebook science]]. I wrote [a blog post](https://www.dannygarside.co.uk/blog/open-notebook-science) about it yesterday, but the tl;dr is: I'm going to start trying to do my work in the open. It's something I've wanted to try for a long time, and I'm going to give it a go.
- Some technical details
	- This is written using [[logseq]], and publishing it was simpler than I anticipated.
	- I already use [[logseq]] for my personal life notes, and also for the notes for the I made while working in the [[Section on Perception, Cognition, and Action]] ([[Bevil Conway]]'s lab) at the [[Lab of Sensorimotor Research]] at the [[National Institutes of Health]] (see the [blog post](https://www.dannygarside.co.uk/blog/An-open-source-knowledge-management-system-for-the-lab/) about that system), but I thought it would be cleaner to start a new graph for this (the other option would have been to selectively make pages from my personal graph public but I prefer a cleaner cut)
	- Following [these instructions](https://docs.logseq.com/#/page/publishing) I:
		- set `All pages public when publishing` to true
		- `Export graph` -> `Export public pages`
		- I then renamed `index.html` to `open-notebook.html`, and copied that and the static folder into my [website github repo](https://github.com/da5nsy/da5nsy.github.io), committed, pushed, and hey presto!
			- _I could do this because I already had the website and github pages etc set up_
- I think the project I'm going to use as a test case for this is the [[Barrionuevo-Cao replication project]]

	- I started this project back during my PhD
	- I started it because I thought the paper was super interesting, and potentially super important to what I was doing at the time, but I was struggling to understand it from the manuscript alone, and the code wasn't available but all the raw data was (it only used secondary data), and I figured I should be able to code it up pretty quickly myself.
		- Spoiler: it was not quick. But it _was_ worthwhile, I think.
	- The code is here: https://github.com/da5nsy/BarrionuevoCao_Reproduction #MATLAB #github
	- I also wrote a [[Twitter]] thread about it: https://twitter.com/da5nsy/status/1301557204227706881
	- I had this ambition to publish my replication in [[ReScience C]], which I still think would be cool
		- That way, other folks can see that the results are robust (if I recall correctly)
		- and they can run the code themselves, either to verify it, or to tweak it themselves
		- What do I need to do to get there?
			- DOING Run the code again, making note of dependencies
