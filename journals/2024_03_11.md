- [[Big Solar Coop]] - comparing [[Discourse]] and [[Mattermost]] #[[community management]] #[[chat software]]
	- Understand the problem
		- [[Big Solar Coop]] currently uses [[Slack]] for discussion
			- [[Slack]] costs money if we want to access the history
			- [[Slack]] is not open source, and so there is poor alignment in values
			- [[Slack]] is not great for async - for threads that are months/years they get buried
		- There are two (more?) dimensions for discussion: site (site 1, site 2...) and project stage (triage, design,...)
	- What is [[Slack]] used for currently?
		- Quick questions
		- Direct messaging
		- Working out ambiguities (each project is different)
		- Building a sense of community
	- Alternative options:
		- [[Mattermost]] - functionally a drop-in replacement for [[Slack]], but [[open source]] (so, free, and aligns with values)and we can host it ourselves.
		- [[Discourse]] - an [[open-source]] forum software
		- They're quite different things: https://communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/a/2980
	- Capabilities:
		- Both can send DMs (which is a surprise to me!)
			- How to send DM in discourse: https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/how-to-send-messages-in-discourse/646
		- It is possible to integrate the two: https://forum.mattermost.com/t/solved-discourse-integration-with-mattermost/3581
			- It is nice to see that actually [[Mattermost]] uses [[Discourse]] to run *it's own* forum! - https://forum.mattermost.com/
	- Desirable:
		- Able to search/organise both my working group *and* by project
			- E.g. "show me the chat that is happening between designers"
			- but also "show me everything to do with site XYZ"
	- Hosting
		- [[Discourse]]: https://meta.discourse.org/t/recommended-hosting-providers-for-self-hosters/79562
		- [[Discourse]] offers a paid hosting system
		- [[Mattermost]]'s offering matches [[Slack]] more closely (and actually, currently they don't seem to be forefronting an offering of hosting)
		- My proposal: play around with both, push forwards to discover any unpredictable blockers
			- [[Jon Halle]]: We actually already have a [[discourse]] instance running
				- I'll focus on that primarily for now then!
	- Discussion:
		- What does [[Noel]] want?
			- Something that works!
			- Single sign on
		- Uploading images - do we want to push people to use [[Sol]]?
		- thought: what about nofications?
		- [[recommendations]]
			- [[recommendation/book]] from [[Jon Halle]] - Rules for Revolutionaries
			- [[recommendation/book]] from [[Noel Lambert]] - The Art of Community - Charles H. Vogl, Content Strategy for the web - Kristina Halvorson

		- Where does this become paid work?
			- Discovery stage is vountary
			- Transition and support is paid
			- Historical data - import data
			- Look into whether I would be self-employed or go through payroll
				- https://www.gov.uk/employment-status/selfemployed-contractor
		- Can I share these notes through my [[open notebook]]?
			- Yes!
				- No: discussion of specific people, projects etc
				- Might change when this becomes paid work
			- Could also eventually be a blog post and/or a contribution to stir magazine https://www.stirtoaction.com/magazine
			- [[Noel]]'s info on "why [[Slack]]?"
				- https://www.contensis.com/community/blog/were-using-slack-for-community-discussion
				-
	- Action points:
		- [[Jon Halle]] will send me access to the existing [[Discourse]] instance for me to play around with. Goal: work out what functionality we currently have in [[Slack]] might not be possible in [[Discourse]] and devise potential behavioral workarounds.
